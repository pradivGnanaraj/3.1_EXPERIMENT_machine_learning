# Machine Learning 

## What it contains
This repository consists most of the frequently used machine learning parametric and non parametric models. 

This repository contains Deep Learning, Self supervised Learning and Semi-supervised learning models. 

## What not to expect
This repo does not contain Operations. The models are experimented in the notebook/PyCharm. 

Deployment of machine learning models are handled in a seperate repository. 

## About Dataset
Most of the datasets used here are generated for running the model. The datasets used in notebooks may or may not contain.
